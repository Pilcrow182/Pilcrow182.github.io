RESOLVED:

0001 (Tetanus): Fixed
  refactor dropping the piece into
    finding where the piece will land if dropped
    placing the piece there
0002 (Tetanus): Fixed
  refactor erasing piece into
  erasing things that are covered by tile-sprites
0003 (Tetanus): Fixed
  Add ghost piece using tile 0x88
0004 (Effects): WONTFIX
  Change to center and width architecture
    Tried it, didn't provide much benefit over L/R.
0005 (Effects): Fixed
  Profile effects' CPU usage
0006 (Effects): WONTFIX
  If necessary, rewrite effects in assembly language
    WONTFIX because even the most cpu intensive set of simultaneous
    effects doesn't take near enough scanlines to overflow past
    vblank.
0009 (UI): Fixed
  Switch BCD translator to use division by constant multiplication
0011 (UI): Fixed
  Add title screen menu with endless, 40 lines, 3 minutes
0012 (UI): WONTFIX
  Add short / long slides to options menu
    Long slides affect the style of play too much to be a simple
    option.  They're now governed by the choice of play style
    (normal vs. Death Mode).
0016 (Help): Fixed
  Change pause into a menu rather than button-oriented
0017 (Statistics): Fixed
  Gradually rotate and shift the background
0020 (Music Engine): Fixed
  Add sample channel
0030 (Effects): Fixed
  work on every other scanline instead of every other frame
0031 (Music): DUPLICATE of 0013
  Add music menu
0032 (Music): Fixed
  Write music for "complete!"
0033 (Music Engine): Fixed
  Add note names to input language
0037 (Graphics): Fixed
  Ditch the alpha blended playfield; it doesn't help,
  and it hurts performance on emulators.
0038 (UI): Fixed
  Title screen needs more explanation of the menu and a
  copyright notice.
0039 (Tetanus): WONTFIX
  Add an animation for clearing lines
    WONTFIX because more animation than a simple hilite of cleared
    lines (what it does now) would either slow down the game (if done
    within the m7 layer) or not be possible to calculate (if done
    with sprites).
0041 (Music Engine): Fixed
  Add a sample channel for notes
0045 (Music): Fixed
  Add sound effects for common events
0046 (Music Engine): Fixed
  Add portamento
0047 (Graphics): Fixed
  Switch from LZO to GBA internal LZ77
0048 (Music Engine): Fixed
  Optimize mixer
0049 (Build Tools): Fixed
  Streamline makefile per
  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/gbadev/message/13227
0050 (Tetanus): Fixed
  Rotation exploit: |: u b u a :| keeps piece in air
0051 (Tetanus): Fixed
  Add death mode
0052 (UI): Fixed
  Add UI to select death mode
0053 (UI): WONTFIX
  Exit doesn't go back to the shell on Visoly carts.  Use the
  reset command of Multiboot Menu or PogoShell.
0057 (Effects): Fixed
  Reduce hgrcos.inc from u32 to u16 (translate 0 to 65536 below
  phi=45deg)
0059 (Music Engine): Fixed
  Investigate periodic mixer dropouts (at 30 Hz) which turned out to
  be misalignment of mixbuf[]
0060 (Graphics): Fixed
  Clearing a line that completely clears the playfield (possibly any
  clear without falling) makes a hole in the pf background.
  (If the problem was in ClearOutCleared(), then it's fixed now.)
