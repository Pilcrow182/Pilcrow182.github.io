M4 (released 20060722)
* Main
  * Took out Visoly/F2A bankswitch reset code, as Visoly/F2A doesn't
    dominate the user base nearly as much as it used to.  Reset now
    properly exits to Multiboot Menu, GBA Movie Player, etc.
  * Doesn't assume interrupts are disabled while starting up,
    so it plays nicer with GBA Movie Player.
  * Renamed to Lockjaw: The Overdose for less chance of trademark
    violation.
  * Main menu skips nonexistent Options.
* Game engine
  * Rotation states and wall kick match those of Tetramino
    (homebrew for NES).
* Graphics
  * Added new VRAM address macros to initvram.c tile data loading
    code, which should make it easier to understand and maintain.
  * Changed blinking block effect to use one tile (0:5) instead of
    32 (0:160-191, one for each palette color), changing its palette
    entry (48) when setting the next pieces' palette entries.
  * Quit changed to Exit to avoid confusion with Quiz.
* Effects
  * On game over, screen now fades to white, and stats fades
    from white.
  * Converted effects from weave interlacing of texture coordinates
    (which was introduced in M2) to linear interpolated bob
    interlacing.  Now the effect animation looks smoother on
    progressive displays such as Game Boy Player and emulators.
  * Took out scrolling and reduced scaling for the first 20 seconds.
  * No longer increments game level on game over.
* Mixer
  * Mixer now disassembles mixbus sample vectors manually to avoid
    pointer aliasing warnings.

M3 (released 20030629)
* Main
  * Added reset option that actually works with PogoShell, both as
    tod.gba and as tod.mb.
  * Game loop now spins on vcount a lot less.
* Tetanus
  * Added "death mode" where pieces start out on top of existing
    blocks (instead of in the air), and you have to slide them into
    place before they lock.
  * Changed slide-after-drop from 15 frames to 13 (non death mode)
    or 25 (death mode)
  * Changed piece fall rate after line clearing from 3 frames/line
    to 2 frames/line.
  * Reduced frame delays all around for more fluid game play.
  * Sped up MarkSquares() significantly by skipping 4x4 regions
    whose UL corner is connected to something above or to the left.
    PLEASE TELL ME if squares that should form fail to form.
  * Sped up CarbonFallOnce() for large empty regions.
  * Beginning of smart-rotation code:  When rotating a piece into
    a position that would overlap blocks, it now tries moving the
    piece up one space.
  * Plugged a few loopholes that let the player keep pieces alive
    forever.  However, some remain to be plugged.
* Graphics
  * Switched from MFXJ Oberhumer's LZO to GBA's built-in LZSS codec
    for more freedom in separately licensing TOD to publishers.
  * Changed 'kaleid' backgrounds' dither pattern to be slightly
    more compressible.
* Effects
  * Changed hgrcos() to use a table of u16s rather than u32s,
    saving 2 KB.
* Pause and Help
  * In pause menu, added sleep option that keeps TOD in the GBA's
    memory while drawing negligible current.
* Music Engine
  * Mixer is a couple times faster now; it mixes n voices in only
    5 + 5n scanlines, less for non-looping or rarely-looping voices.
  * Tempo changes are no longer delayed by one row.
  * init_sound() now calls BIOS SetSoundBias() to work around a bug
    in PogoShell 1.3's sound disabling code.
  * Portamento and volume change effects added.
  * Uses a different method to force mix buffer to a 4-byte boundary.
* Music
  * Changed GB sound to mono for more consistent instrument balance
    on headphones vs. speakers.  Changed some volumes around to
    compensate.
* Documentation
  * Added notice about what emulators other than VBA are missing.
  * Added system requirements for game play under emulation.
  * Explained new Death Mode.
  * Began Q&A section.
* Tools
  * Made the build system work in one step, with MinGW ahead of
    Devkit Advance in the path.
  * Upgraded compiler toolchain to Devkit Advance R5 beta 3.
  * Added LZSS compressor.
  * Fixed a problem with the commonly available LZSS compressor,
    where the compressed bytestream would illegally reference bytes
    before the start of the decompressed data, causing corruption
    of 0x00 or 0x20 runs during decompression.

M2 (released 20020628)
* Main
  * moved play_tod() into its own function
  * brought in new pin8gba.h with timers, ISRs, and more sound
    definitions
  * added multiplication by a fractional (between 0 and 1) number
* Tetanus
  * made the game keep track of how many singles, doubles, triples,
    tet*ises, etc. the player makes
  * changed slide-after-drop time to 15 frames (was 30) to
    improve pacing
  * added end modes: time trial and 150 dash
  * used a dirty-rows system instead of draw/undraw to draw
    tile-sprites such as the falling piece
  * refactored figuring out where the piece will fall out of the
    down key handling
  * added an additional tile-sprite that displays where a piece will
    land after an up keypress
* Music Engine
  * converted music engine to use files instead of hardcoded arrays
  * added drum and bass samples to music
* Music
  * added music for stats screen
* Statistics
  * added display of singles, doubles, etc.
* Graphics
  * changed gameplay background to read the first 64 values from the
    Rijndael S-box fuzzbase rather than computing 64 iterations of
    slow-ass newlib rand()
  * lightened the playfield background from 50% density to 25%
  * removed the alpha blend on the playfield, as it wasn't noticeable
    enough to warrant the performance hit on popular emulators
  * Changed the default background to the third one (kaleid1) instead
    of the one with the pot leaf
* Effects
  * switched from struct-of-arrays to array-of-structs
    to free up more registers for the optimizer
  * interlacing lets the effects run at 60fps instead of 30fps
  * sped up centering around piece.  Now the game feels crisper.
* Pause and Help
  * removed empty "NeXT" column from pause screen
  * changed the pause menu to be an actual menu
* UI General
  * added title screen menu for selecting end mode
  * uncluttered the title screen
  * made the copyright notice a subscreen of the Pin Eight logo
    screen
* Documentation
  * added title screen menu and pause menu to manual
  * added detail to game play
  * added bug logging
* Tools
