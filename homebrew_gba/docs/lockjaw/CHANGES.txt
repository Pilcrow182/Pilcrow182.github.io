0.46a (2008-11-09)
  * Preview at top is copied correctly from the back buffer
    (0.45a regression, reported by rednefed).

_____________________________________________________________________
0.46 (2008-11-08)
  * Tracks number of 4x4 squares that the player forms
    (TOD parity; requested by Ghett0).
  * Added T-Party randomizer (requested by Lardarse).
  * Default lock delay for Zero set to 40 frames, even if it is
    played first (0.45 regression, reported by rck).
  * "[TC]" removed from scenario names (requested by caffeine).
  * PC: Uses fourCCs for option values in lj.ini.
  * PC: Uses double buffer for entire background (bug 0021).
  * PC: Can disable sound effects by deleting or renaming sound.dat
    (requested by moxie101).
  * PC: More of the code is 2-player-clean.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.45 (2008-04-20)
  * New unified speed curve system: less code, more tables, for
    future loading from a file (bug 0040).
  * All speed curves except Rhythm and Rhythm Zero have been ported
    to the new system.  Notably, Master has been rewritten based on
    the tables from the wiki, and Exponential uses sections.  The
    lock delay speeds up as brutally after 600 pieces as always.
  * Added kludge in the basic makefile that allows building on *BSD
    and GNU/Linux: 'make linux' (patch by kesiev).
  * ljpath: Fixed a couple misspellings in the non-Windows code path
    (reported by kesiev).
  * ljpath: Supports libfat when running on Nintendo DS.
  * A few descriptions of options have been shortened to fit into
    the new GBA/DS look (reported by Bloodstar; patch by caffeine).
  * Writes result and options text to standard output as well as to
    lj-scores.txt. This allows you to do 'lj | postprocessor' even
    if you can't do 'tail -f lj-scores.txt' (requested by kesiev).
  * DS: Writes result and options to /data/lockjaw/lj-scores.txt.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.44 (2008-02-20)
  * Computes the preview and hold offset of all pieces (was
    wkNextMove in <= 0.43) from the entry position of the I
    tetromino (was wkSpawnMove in <= 0.43).
  * Kick tables have been inverted to a single struct per rotation
    system, for future loading from a file (bug 0016).
  * SKIP_IF system for handling J/L/T exceptions in Arika is replaced
    with IF_NOT_CENTER: wall kicks are allowed if the free-space
    orientation overlaps any blocks other than in the center column.
  * Options DAS doesn't repeat too fast, even on those systems where
    vsync() is a no-op (0.43 regression, reported by caffeine).
    This has the same cause as 0022: Windows Vista ignores vsync().
  * Options DAS doesn't continue across page boundaries.
  * GBA/DS: Options has new look.
  * DS: Reads the touch screen and the X and Y buttons.  Right now,
    touch isn't mapped to anything, but X and Y are Far Right and
    Far Left.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.43a (2008-02-11)
  * Arika modified to use SKIP_IF3 after (not before) the basic
    position.  This restores ability to rotate J, L, and T with
    kicks turned off, such as in IRS (reported by Lion).
  * PC: Uses shfolder.dll so that installability works even on
    Windows 98 (0.43 regression, reported by Rich Nagel).
  * PC: Key bindings to J, M, and Z are correctly saved (0.43
    regression, reported by DIGITAL).
  * PC: In Game Keys, the names of Up and Down key bindings are
    clearer (requested by 4matsy).

_____________________________________________________________________
0.43 (2008-02-10)
  * Player can initial-rotate out of block out (bug 0090).
  * Initial rotation doesn't use wall kick (bug 0059).
  * Names for values in Drop scoring and Shadow fixed
    (0.42 regression, reported by Lardarse).
  * Number of line clears in DS debrief should be cut off at the
    right side less often (bug 0089; fix based on a patch by kesiev).
  * Fixed line clear gravity in cascade preset (reported by 4matsy).
  * Fixed Fibonacci scoring with more than 8 lines per piece
    (reported by 4matsy).
  * Debrief is more compact, allowing GBA to use debrief (bug 0031;
    fix based on a patch by kesiev).
  * Debrief: Zigzag secret grade requires the hole in the top row to
    be covered (reported by Kitaru).
  * PC: If installed.txt is in the same folder as the program,
    ignores the current directory and stores all writable files
    to the user's application data folder (bug 0091).
  * PC: When loading skins, searches for files in the folder with
    the .skin file instead of the current directory (bug 0033).
  * PC: Replay sets up playback gimmick (0.42 regression,
    reported by DIGITAL).
  * PC: LJVorbis doesn't double-fclose the .ogg file
    (reported by kesiev).
  * PC: Mouse drops to bottom after skin or replay selection
    (requested by jujube).
  * PC: Options is separated into pages, like on GBA/DS (bug 0082).
    This frees up room for larger type (requested by jujube).

_____________________________________________________________________
0.42 (2008-02-03) aka LOCKJAW XLII
  * Docs: Most of TODO.txt has been converted to a numbered list
    of bugs (bug 0100).
  * An off-by-1/65536 error in enter below ceiling was fixed.
    This means it doesn't give one extra row of room to slide on
    at the top of the well (reported by Caithness and Kukuunen).
  * In case of a block out, draws the offending piece in the well
    before entering game over animation.
  * Extra 5-frame cascade delay removed.
  * With Lockdown set to Step reset, lock delay resets on the
    first floor kick.
  * Tengen rotation system tries kicking one space to the left
    (requested by zaphod77).
  * Options' names and values are looked up from fourCCs for future
    localizability.
  * Options: Names of speeds in fractions of 1G are computed.
  * Options skips unpacking options with a value of 255.
    This allows multiple pref structures to be unpacked on top
    of each other, and each overrides the ones before it.
  * Debrief displays options on a second page.
  * Debrief correctly displays soft drop speed as a fraction (0.41
    regression, reported by Lardarse).
  * Debrief: PC specific parts moved to separate source code file.
  * Debrief uses a lower-level function to format ISO 8601 date
    and time so as not to bring in the floating-point library's
    space overhead on platforms without an FPU.
  * Debrief plays a sound when turning the page.
  * PC: Delay for holding Esc to quit no longer depends on
    display refresh rate.  Instead, it uses the global 60 Hz
    timer (reported by Sara).
  * PC: Draws speedometer even when preview is at right,
    as long as there is room, that is, 3 or fewer next pieces
    (requested by Cubicz).
  * PC: Gimmick choice moved to Options to match GBA/DS.
  * PC: Select scenario before starting game (bug 0041).
  * PC options uses standardized GBA names (OPTIONS_*) instead of
    PC names (LJPREFS_*).
  * PC options Shift sound scale, Side, and Next position moved to
    skin.
  * PC options sets initial options using initOptions() from GBA/DS.
    Incidentally, this restores the initial randomizer to bag
    (0.41 regression and may make similar regressions less likely.
  * PC options uses unpackOptions() from GBA/DS.
  * PC options sound is also routed through the cross-platform
    sound manager.
  * PC: lj.ini uses fourCCs as names for easier saving and loading.
  * PC: Switching between windowed and full screen in Options
    no longer needs the user to restart the program.
  * PC: LJVorbis doesn't crash if polled while the music is stopped.
    This can happen when cross-platform code plays sound effects
    during debrief.
  * PC: Skin controls window size, or full screen resolution
    (bug 0017).
  * PC/DS: Displays a description of some option values in addition
    to descriptions of options themselves.
  * GBA/DS: Options disabled on the PC are disabled here.
  * GBA: Menus are faster now that part of the text engine has been
    moved to fast RAM.
  * DS: Plays sound for game over (bug 0064).
  * DS: Options displayed on touch screen for future touch operation.
  * DS: Displays debrief after game ends (bug 0031).

_____________________________________________________________________
0.41 (2007-12-18)
  * Piece set and randomizer are decoupled (requested by Lardarse
    and Dood77).
  * New piece set: iCheat(tm) deals only I tetrominoes, like an
    infamous cheat code for some other game (requested by DIGITAL).
  * New garbage style "Preload zigzag", which preloads a zigzag
    pattern of holes.
  * At debrief time, if at least two rows of the zigzag pattern
    or at least four rows of a rectum (1-block-wide opening) are
    formed, shows a secret grade based on the number of pattern
    rows instead of the number of blocks left in the playfield.
  * Debrief options section sorted by position in options menu.
  * Debrief allows for multiple pages of reports.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.40a (2007-11-30)
  * Does not attempt to create a ghost piece before the first
    falling piece.  This may fix a crash on some systems if the
    first game played during a session has deep drop turned on
    (reported by Rich Nagel on Windows 98 Second Edition).
  * Deep drop ghost piece code stops checking at the ceiling.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.40 (2007-11-27)
  * Split out speed curves and randomizers to separate files called
    speed.c and random.c.
  * Adjusted master delays to be closer to TAP; 600-999 no longer
    overlap Death 000-399.
  * Displays short description of each option (requested by AXYPB).
  * Drill gimmick is back, with the new goal of clearing the bottom
    row (requested by DIGITAL).
  * Begin to add code for explosive line clear gimmick; not yet
    integrated (requested by Joshua).
  * Debrief shows number of floor kicks.
  * Bottom blocks is called Deep drop to match recent Multiblocks.
  * PC: Close box works in Options and Game Keys.
  * PC: Does not redraw title screen if close box is clicked.
  * PC: If skin sets transparentPF=1, hotlines and line clear
    animations are drawn transparent (requested by Rich Nagel).
  * GBA/DS: Can quit game from pause screen (requested by AXYPB).
  * GBA/DS: Copyright notice and options screen drawn with
    proportional font for readability.
  * GBA/DS: Menu uses the same sound manager that the game play
    uses, not the platform-specific sound manager.
  * GBA: Sound for end of game (requested by Lardarse).
  * DS: Closing the lid pauses the game and turns off the screens
    (requested by AXYPB).
  * DS: Unavailable hold piece is really grayed out.
  * DS: Real music and sound effects engine (requested by
    bob_fossil).

_____________________________________________________________________
0.39 (2007-10-24)
  * Does not double line clear delay (unknown regression).
  * Source code includes new files options.h and old_pc_options.c
    which were mistakenly left out of 0.38 (reported by tr3).
  * Draws "hotline" symbol on lines being cleared (requested by
    Rosti LFC and kiwibonga).
  * Debrief no longer counts a zero line T-spin as a home run
    (0.28 regression; reported by Lardarse).
  * New randomizer 7+1-piece Bag adds one randomly selected
    tetromino to each bag (requested by colour_thief).
  * Refactored speed curve state information for pseudo-OO
    refactoring.
  * New option: Bottom blocks allows the falling piece to fall past
    blocks into an appropriately shaped hole (requested by mar).
  * Added bottom blocks and well size to debrief.
  * New gluing options Sticky and Sticky by color.
  * PC: Skin specifies the loop point and whether the music starts
    before or after the "Ready, Go" animation.
  * PC: Skin specifies music volume (requested by DIGITAL).
  * PC: Fixed off-by-one in sideways delay (reported by Lardarse).
  * PC: Fields with blkH > 24, especially blkH == 48 and Well height
    10, are more likely to fit on screen (reported by Needle).

_____________________________________________________________________
0.38 (2007-09-11)
  * Plays a .ljm specified at the command line (requested by
    Rich Nagel).
  * More refactoring for multiplayer.
  * Added wall kick opcode SKIP_IF3, similar to SKIP_IF except it
    also checks the two cells above the specified cell.
  * L, J, and T in Arika use SKIP_IF3 to check the entire center
    column when rotating to vertical (requested by edo).
  * Moves new tetrominoes to be between the walls (fixing Tengen in
    width 4) and, if "Enter above playfield" is off, down far enough
    so that they're within the playfield (requested by Caithness).
  * New rotation system: Climbing, based on Tetris DX.  (No, you
    can't wall-climb yet because the sub-block behavior differs.)
  * Option "4x4 squares" is called "Gluing".  Other gluing options
    are planned.
  * In Square gluing, formation of a square adds a delay
    equal to line clear delay.
  * PC: Refactored to share some of the GBA/DS options logic.
  * PC: Moved most sound effect code into pcsound.c.
  * PC: Sound for 4x4 square formation (cribbed from TOD).
  * PC: Reloads the default skin's configuration before loading 
    the skin, so that skins always inherit from the default skin
    and not the last chosen skin (requested by Rich Nagel).
  * GBA: Uses duration as priority for square wave sound effects,
    which should prevent the section up sound from getting
    interrupted as often.
  * GBA/DS: Draws real-time speedometer.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.37 (2007-07-09)
  * Requires "Up" and "Alt firm drop" to be pressed again when
    lock delay is turned off or less than DAS delay
    (requested by reivilo).
  * Keypress count is reset to 0 even in "Play .ljm" (reported by
    jujube).
  * Playing a broken .ljm from the gimmick menu gives an informative
    error message instead of crashing (0.32a regression; reported by
    Rosti LFC).
  * Rhythm section-up logic waits for 64 beats at L bpm, not L+1 bpm.
  * Fixed a potential buffer overflow in shuffleColumns (the "banana"
    item), brought on by the expansion of the playfield to 12 columns
    (0.33 regression).
  * Better comments in source code about wall kick entry macros
    WK(x, y), WKX(wk), WKY(wk) in lj.h (requested by Lardarse).
  * PC: Reinstate Bach music while investing a trademark claim.
  * PC: Separate music for Rhythm speed curves.
  * PC: Does not use stretch blitter when drawing the blocks of
    sprite pieces at full size (e.g. falling piece).
  * PC: blitField() blits adjacent rows in one call, which is
    faster on slow machines (requested by Matthew).
  * PC: Size of hold piece respects blkW and blkH.
  * README describes build instructions for GBA and DS.
  * For user convenience, the Allegro DLL is included with the
    executable, and the source code is in a separate archive.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.36 (2007-05-21)
  * Allows DAS delay up to 400 ms (requested by Rich Nagel).
  * Option for entry within or above ceiling (requested by DIGITAL
    and Cubicz).
  * Option for hold piece behavior (requested by Lardarse).

    (requested by DIGITAL and Rosti LFC).
  * PC: Minor changes to included background music.
  * PC: Option for playing a scale during sideways motion
    (requested by herc).
  * PC: Selecting a skin saves options (reported by Rich Nagel).
  * PC: When loading saved options, treats 16 ms DAS delay as valid
    (reported by jujube).
  * PC: Skin setting for a transparent background (requested by
    cdsboy and Bloodstar).
  * PC: Demo recording uses "Rec" and "Play" in addition to icons.
  * PC: Reallocates back buffer after each skin switch, avoiding
    problems related to changes in blkW and blkH (reported by
    Rich Nagel).
  * GBA/DS: Fixed line clear options (0.34 regression).
  * GBA/DS: Press Start after lose, rather than timing out to options
    (requested by Webby).
  * "Default" means not to pay back a loan.  Manual uses "initial"
    or "preset" instead (requested by Bruce Tognazzini).

_____________________________________________________________________
0.35 (2007-04-25)
  * New speed curve Game Boy Heart.
  * New speed curve Death 300+, which starts three sections into
    Death just like cgwg's cheat for TAP (requested by Amnesia).
  * New randomizer 10-piece Memoryless.
  * First garbage line takes into account well width (reported by
    Lardarse).
  * Displays section number for NES, Game Boy, and Game Boy Heart
    speed curves (requested by Rich Nagel).
  * Debrief displays Quadra-style pieces per active minute
    (requested by Cubicz).
  * Debrief calls pieces "pieces" instead of "tetrominoes" in
    10-piece randomizers because I2, I3, L3 are not tetrominoes.
  * PC: Gimmick and level are displayed in skin foreground color
    (missed in 0.30; reported by Rich Nagel).
  * PC: Skin file name suffix is now .skin not .ini, so that skin.ini
    cannot be confused with lj.ini.  The default skin is called
    default.skin not skin.ini.
  * PC: Title screen has option to select skin (requested by
    cdsboy).
  * PC: Block size is no longer hard-coded at 24x24 pixels.
    The new .skin commands blkW= and blkH= control their size
    (requested by Bloodstar).
  * PC: Source code comes with new installation guide written by
    Lardarse in "docs/Compiling_on_Windows.txt".

_____________________________________________________________________
0.33 (2007-03-08)
  * New speed curve Rhythm Zero is identical to Rhythm except it
    operates at 0G instead of 20G (requested by Cubicz and caffeine).
  * Speed curves that do not use level reset level to 0.
    Therefore, playing a game of Death then a game of Exponential
    on GBA/DS no longer shows the level that the player finished
    Death on as the level during Exponential.
  * Maximum well width increased to 12 (requested by Zed0).
  * Hold piece does not reset floor kicks, lock delay time in entry
    reset, or Rhythm's placement timer.

    Allegro file selector pops up, and the player can choose the
    filename of a demo to play back (requested by Lardarse).

_____________________________________________________________________
0.32 (2007-02-13)
  * Changed a CPU yield behavior that was affecting battery
    efficiency on the GBA and DS front ends (reported by Mighty Max).
  * Removed Low Rider gimmick in favor of option for well height
    (requested by Matthew).
  * Option for well width, like Shimizu's Tetris Semipro-68k.
    Combine this with a low well height to simulate BIG mode of
    TGM and Heboris (requested by Matthew).
  * Options for entry delay and sideways delay have "max" added to
    their description to clarify things (requested by kotetsu213 and

  * Draws the score and next pieces before blitting the playfield
    in case a front-end draws the score or next pieces inside the
    playfield.
  * In Baboo!, speed curve Zero sets the level to the number of
    keypresses so far.
  * PC, GBA: Plays sound effect for end of section in speed curves
    that use sections (Master, Death, NES, Game Boy).
  * PC: Option to draw next pieces inside the playfield, above the
    shadow (requested by caffeine, cdsboy, and Cubicz).
  * GBA, DS: Blocks within a piece are drawn connected once they lock
    (TOD parity, requested by Lardarse and Bloodstar).
  * GBA, DS: Baboo! no longer double-counts console buttons passed
    through the joypad reading code.
  * README: "color=image" clone-and-hack error fixed (reported by
    Bloodstar).
  * README: Explains black rectangle in upper left corner as an
    icon for stop (requested by herc).
  * README: Explains controls on GBA and DS.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.30 (2007-02-01)
  * Fixed ARE display in debrief, which could cause a crash in some
    situations (0.26 regression?).
  * Garbage no longer self-clears in Cascade gravity (reported by
    Bloodstar).
  * In high gravity, land a T with one block over an overhang and
    rotate it once so that it falls and clears a line.  This is no
    longer counted as a T-spin.
  * During a replay, counts keypresses by the replay player.
  * PC: Scales undersized background images to the size of the window
    (requested by Bloodstar).
  * PC: If a piece enters during a skipped frame, a second upward
    trail is no longer drawn (reported by Bloodstar and caffeine).
  * PC: "Next at top" layout draws speedometer (requested by
    matt_hatter83).
  * PC: Trails option is saved properly (reported by caffeine).
  * PC: User can customize the game's text and background colors
    using skin.ini (requested by Bloodstar).

    Dock, M3 Pro, SuperCard Rumble, or SLOT-1 cards, which can run
    DS homebrew but not GBA homebrew.
  * Moscow Nights removed from lj-contrib due to research into the
    copyright term extensions enacted by Russian Federation during
    the 1990s.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.29 (2007-01-17)
  * TDS scoring recognizes chains properly (reported by Lardarse).

    and Tetris DS Touch.
  * Master/Death: Level starts at -1, so that the first piece is
    played at level 0 (requested by Lardarse).
  * Changed T-spin detection to save whether or not a rotation
    involved a kick (0: move; 1: rotate; 2: rotate with kick) so
    that scoring methods such as TDS can score T-spins with and
    without kicks differently.
  * Added TDS scoring method (line clears only).
  * New, more general, possibly easier to understand reshuffle code
    in bag randomizer (requested by Lardarse)
  * GBA: Gold and silver square colors added (requested by Lardarse).
  * PC: Game over in low ceiling no longer fades the area outside the
    playfield (reported by Lardarse).

    (0.25? regression, reported by Lardarse).
  * Fixed incorrect win/loss sound early in 180 seconds (0.25
    regression).
  * New randomizer 10-piece Bag, including the domino and both
    trominoes.
  * GBA version now reports entry and lock delays in both frames
    and milliseconds.
  * Possibly fixed off-by-one in Game Boy speed curve section
    computation, which caused an incorrect slowdown in 210-219
    section (reported by Ezzelin).

0.26 (2006-12-15)
  * Option to allow game to proceed in the background (requested by
    Ezzelin).  However, Windows doesn't appear to pass joystick
    presses to the game running in the background.  FCE Ultra has
    what appears to be exactly the same problem.
  * Added Game Boy and NES speed curves.
  * Options and Game Keys are accessed through title screen, not
    gimmick selection.
  * Option to hide playfield without changing the skin.
  * Rearranged rules section of options to correspond more closely to
    the sequence of operations for each tetromino.
  * Soft or hard drop set to "lock on release" no longer produces
    double locks at 20G.
  * Disable initial hard drop when set to "lock" and entry delay is
    greater than 0 but less than DAS delay.
  * Checks for 4x4 squares top to bottom per comparison with The New
    Tetris (N64).
  * Finer grained selections in entry delay (requested by
    matt_hatter83) and lock delay (requested by caffeine).
    They now are at 50ms increments at the low end.
  * Expanded TGM speed curve to 12 sections.  One comparatively slow
    section at 20G was added to Master before Death-equivalent starts
    (now Death 0 is equivalent to Master 600, not 500), and one
    faster section was added to the end of Death based on info posted
    to wiki by colour_thief.
  * Added H.R. Derby gimmick:
    Like Marathon, but every line you clear other than with a
    home run or a T-spin gives you garbage.
  * Ready Go animation is 1.2 seconds, not 2.0 seconds.
  * Preliminary support for Game Boy Advance, with experimental
    paged options replacing scrolling options.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.25 (2006-11-28)
  * Fixed History 6 Rolls deciding between the first piece algorithm
    and the subsequent pieces algorithm (reported by Lardarse).
  * Fixed a signedness issue that broke 180 seconds gimmick in the
    case that a tetromino was kept active between 3:00 and 3:01 (0.24
    regression; reported by caffeine).
  * Allows ending the game with a piece in mid-air (0.24 regression).
  * Removed Arika and renamed Arika+TI to Arika.  For the old
    Arika behavior, set Options:Floor kicks to 0.
  * Options screen allows DAS, allowing future versions to make more
    options and more values for each option available in a less
    cumbersome way.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.24 (2006-11-16)
  * Added Score style to options and debrief.
  * Choice of LJ or TNT64 scoring is based on chosen score style, not
    whether 4x4 squares are turned on.
  * Added Hotline scoring method, where only lines cleared on
    specific rows count toward scoring.  When enabled, draws white
    lines through empty spaces in these rows.
  * New soft drop and hard drop lock setting: Lock on release.  It's
    a spring-loaded system:  When you press the button, it doesn't
    lock, but when you let go, it locks (requested by colour_thief).
  * Option to override lock delay time (requested by caffeine).
  * Option to limit upward kicks (requested by Needle). This may
    obviate the difference between Arika and Arika+TI.
  * Sped up line clear in Master 300-499 to make less of a jarring
    transition to "death" style timings.
  * LJM loading fails even more gracefully on wrong format version,
    properly treating an LJM of the wrong version as not existing.
  * Fixed bug in 0.23's application switch pausing where switching
    away while already paused would require two Esc presses to
    continue (reported by caffeine).
  * Does not stop play until after the line clear animation finishes.
    This allows the game to properly update the single, double,
    triple, etc. counts for the last line that completes the goal
    (0.19 scoring regression?; reported by caffeine).
  * Refactored duplicated option loading code.
  * Options: Ditched parallel struct and array in favor of a
    single list of named indices.
  * Corrected Moscow Nights and Kalinka in lj-contrib for greater
    compatibility with obscure s3m players that can't handle odd
    numbers of channels (requested by Lardarse).

_____________________________________________________________________
0.23 (2006-11-04)
  * Fixed S and Z in Sega 1988.
  * DUMB has been wrapped in a library called LJMusic and can be
    turned off at compile time (edit ljmusic.c and makefile) if you
    don't want to install DUMB.
  * Added support for Xiph.org's OggVorbis codec to LJMusic
    (requested by Needle).
  * Option to ignore sideways movement on first frame (like TGM
    series) (requested by Needle, seconded by caffeine).
  * Properly pauses the game when the player switches away from the
    window (requested by Lardarse).
  * Fails gracefully (does nothing) instead of crashing when loading
    replay files of a different format version.
  * Moved as much as possible below setting display mode so that
    people porting LJ to other platforms can toss up working alert()
    boxes earlier (requested by cdsboy).

_____________________________________________________________________
0.22 (2006-10-23)
  * Fixed color system change after reloading (0.20 regression?,
    reported by lardarse).  Should always unpack options just before
    loading skin.
  * All numbers in saved states are stored big-endian, making movies
    compatible between 0.22 for Windows and Intel Mac and 0.22 for
    PowerPC Mac (requested by cdsboy).
  * Sega rotation systems renamed to Arika for less confusion with
    the rotation systems in Sega's Tetris games from 1988 and 1998
    (requested by Needle).
  * Added Sega 1988 rotation system (like Arika without wall kicks).
  * Preliminary Vorbis playback code is included in the source code
    distribution but has not been activated in the program.
    (The keys to compiling OggVorbis on MinGW+MSYS are 1. set the
    prefix to match the MINGDIR you used to build Allegro, and
    2. disable creation of the shared library.)

_____________________________________________________________________
0.21 (2006-10-21)
  * Added new T-spin detection rule "3-corner T no kick", identical
    to 3-corner T except that a wallkick is not counted as a rotation
    (requested by kotetsu213).
  * Options that don't apply because of how another option is set
    are grayed out with an explanation (requested by Needle).
  * Debrief tells number of blocks left in the playfield and whether
    saved state was used (requested by caffeine).
  * Debrief tells what level the player stopped on.
  * Added support for saving input stream ("demo" or "movie") to file
    "demo.ljm".  Press [ to start/stop recording and ] to start/stop
    playback (requested by caffeine).
  * Pieces are actually random again (0.20 regression).
  * New lockdown mode: Entry reset.  Instead of resetting, the lock
    timer pauses while the piece is falling (requested by caffeine).
  * No +20 for banking more than 5 beats (requested by caffeine).
  * 250 ms entry delay option (requested by matt_hatter83).
  * Entry and sideways delays in Master and Death use the shorter of
    the speed curve's delay and the user's delay.
  * Added soft drop speed to options.
  * Added settings 8.6 Hz through 6.7 Hz to Sideways speed.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.20 (2006-10-15)
  * Fixed color system change after options (0.19 regression).
  * Restored ability to hold first piece (0.17 regression?).
  * Requires down to be re-pressed only when entry delay is less
    than sideways delay.
  * In modes with ARE, allow initial hard drop even on first piece
    (requested by caffeine).
  * Visual refresh in Game Keys.
  * Game Keys ignores keypresses for 1/4 second after each key is
    set, which should fix problems with GameCube to USB adapters
    (requested by Caithness).
  * All platforms use a single randomizer, whose state is associated
    with the playfield.
  * ARE is a binary option again, as several speed curves ignored the
    old version's difference between constant and decreasing.
  * Moved version display to title screen.
  * Sound effect for win differs from that for game over.
  * Sound effect for rotating a piece on its first active frame.
  * Begun to add assertions, causing game over if they fail.
  * Added support for saving the state of the playfield.
    Press [ to save or ] to load.  Movies might be next.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.19 (2006-09-28):
  * Use of SRS or Sega colors is determined by a flag set for each
    rotation system.  The rule is that rotation systems that use
    bounding box rotation should use SRS colors.
  * Added TOD M4 rotation system (face up entry + bounding box
    rotation + roughly TGM style compensation).
  * List items in Options flicker much less.
  * Beginning of an actual title screen.
  * Removed Rhythm gimmick in favor of speed curve option.
  * Added Master and Death speed curves (requested by Needle).
    Death hasn't been tested thoroughly because the developer
    sucks at death.
  * Blits only those playfield rows that have changed, making
    animation smoother on old, cheap, or mobile video cards
    (requested by cosmonaut).
  * Rhythm speed curve no longer has what feels like a big elbow
    (requested by caffeine).  Specifically it gives 20 points
    instead of banking more than 5 pieces' worth of time.
  * Doesn't draw the state after the tetromino spawns but before
    initial rotation has taken effect (requested by Needle).
  * Added sound effect for hold piece (requested by Needle).
  * Land and lock sound much better (requested by Needle).
  * Shuffle columns (seen only in Vs. w/ Items) correctly disconnects
    blocks horizontally.
  * In Square mode, T-spins cause avalanches.
  * In Square mode, lines containing a piece of a 4x4 block are worth
    more, and homers are worth less.
  * Fixed ignoring diagonal presses (0.17 regression).
  * Created a new struct "LJPrefs" to hold preferences set by the
    player in the Options menu separately from the parameters
    that the game actually uses. This allows gimmicks to override
    preferences more cleanly.
  * Added support for future scoring methods where the score per line
    at a given point in the chain is based on a formula.
  * Created a union that combines the new struct with the array that
    the Options menu edits to improve maintainability of Options.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.18 (2006-09-16):
  * Fixed Classic lock reset (unknown regression).
  * Fixed misbehavior when hold is pressed after a piece
    lands but before it locks (0.17 regression).
  * Shadow is drawn using the piece's color, at 25% opacity,
    from rows 4 and 5 of ljblocks.
  * Fixed shadow option saving (0.17a regression).
  * Added option to hide shadow color or change shadow opacity.
  * Split Sega rotation system into one with and one without
    TGM3's upward kicks.
  * Added NES and Game Boy rotation systems.
  * README: Illustration of game play has an image map.  The reader
    can select (hover over) a region of the screenshot, and the
    browser will show the title of the region as a tooltip.
  * BPM is now called speed level in preparation for other
    speed curves (including TGM and TA Death).

_____________________________________________________________________
0.17 (2006-09-13):
  * Option for sticky gravity per color, as seen in The Next Tetris.
  * "Ready, Go" is centered, even in low ceiling gimmicks.
  * Added TGM3's upward kick to Sega T rotations.
  * Added Tengen rotation system.
  * Removed TGM gimmick in favor of entry delay option.
  * Initial hold works at any time.  The key can be pressed and
    released during entry delay or even during line clear delay.
  * Initial actions do not inflate keypress count
    (helpful in Baboo! with entry delay).
  * Draws hold piece in garbage colors when it is not available.
  * Options scroll.
  * Option to draw next pieces to right in constant size or above.
  * Better looking scroll bar in options.
  * Debrief: In naive gravity, reports T-spin singles, doubles,
    and triples separately from non-T-spins.  In other line
    clear gravity modes, "home run" is now called "quad".
  * Fixed a buffer overflow bug in sticky: fillCLoop() no longer
    treats the right side of one row and the left side of the
    row above it as one region.
  * Clarified manual as to the purpose of the Vs. gimmicks.
  * Separated platform specific stuff into a separate struct.
  * Refactored scoring into a separate function for future movement
    to gimmick and option control.
  * Debrief formats the report into a string and then writes it
    to a file and the screen all at once.
  * Refactored play() to move everything in the game loop that is
    not platform specific out of ljpc.c into new file ljplay.c.
  * Wall kick table is no longer flipped, making it easier to add
    new rotation systems.
  * Unified counterclockwise and clockwise rotation code.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.16 (2006-09-03):
  * Fixed instant sideways speed (0.15 regression).
  * In countdown modes, debrief screen displays whether clear was
    successful.
  * 6-piece Bag no longer makes Vs. ridiculously easy.
  * Counts score and garbage separately for future shift to
    gimmick-controlled scoring.
  * Displays score instead of garbage on the play screen.
  * Counts singles, doubles, triples, and homers, and displays them
    in debrief.
  * Option to hide falling piece in addition to shadow.
  * Can load mod, xm, or it music in addition to s3m.
  * Moved skin description from lj.ini to skin.ini, and the name of
    this skin description file name can be changed with the Skin=
    command in lj.ini.
  * Closes lj.ini when reading it.
  * All vkey->action game key handling code moved to macro.c for
    future refactoring.
  * Build process uses automatic generation of C files' dependencies
    for future refactoring of header files.
  * Added two versions of NES-style blocks to lj-contrib:
    one by tepples and one by deepdorp.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.15 (2006-08-27):
  * Options for DAS delay, number of next pieces, and window vs.
    full screen.
  * Options scrolling doesn't cause the dialog's title and
    instructions to flicker.
  * Small font's 5 glyph is the same width as other digits.
  * Fixed O shape table.
  * Macros (vkey->action mappings past the first 8) are in a
    lookup table in the new file macro.c.  This paves the way
    for a future macro editor.
  * Added macros Alt. Firm Drop and Alt. Hold.
  * Game Keys displays names for all keys, not just printable keys.
  * In Sega rotation mode, reads block images from ljblocks-sega.bmp
    and ljconn-sega.bmp if available.
  * If ljbg.jpg is not available, uses a plain white backdrop.
  * Reads file names for block images, background image, and music
    from lj.ini, which the player can edit with a text editor.
  * New "6-piece Bag" randomizer is one stick short of a bundle.
  * Added an arrangement of the minuet from JS Bach's French Suite
    in B minor (BWV 814) to lj-contrib.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.14 (2006-08-18):
  * pause() renamed to pauseGame() to fix namespace collision on
    platforms with unistd.h (Linux, BSD, Mac).
  * Gimmick settings for initial gravity, ARE, and ceiling height
    are initialized from a lookup table.
  * History 6 Rolls randomizer uses correct initial history (ZSZS)
    and correct selection for the first piece (I, J, L, or T).
  * Blocks are drawn connected within each tetromino if ljconn.bmp
    is present.
  * Corrected connection table for O tetromino.
  * Rhythm's BPM counter increases after every 64 beats, not every
    64 tetrominoes.
  * Added Low Vs. gimmick:
    Like Vs. CPU with a low ceiling.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.13 (2006-08-15):
  * Hard drop lock option "Zangi" renamed to "Slide".
  * Added soft drop lock option.
  * Ignores diagonal presses differently: instead of pretending the
    keys are up, it pretends that they haven't changed from the last
    frame.  UP, UP+RIGHT, UP no longer makes a double hard drop.
  * Esc pauses the game and music instead of immediately quitting.
  * Added contributions from cdsboy to lj-contrib.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.12 (2006-08-13):
  * Creates lj.ini if it doesn't exist, instead of crashing on
    startup.
  * Added half-size Aver16 font.
  * Zero gravity (as in Baboo!) + Zangi hard drop = land and lock,
    instead of just sit there
  * Option to use classic (Game Boy style) or step-reset (TGM style)
    lockdown instead of move-reset (SRS style) lockdown.
  * Contains connection tables for all pieces.  Not used yet,
    but will be used for Cascade (where gravity is based on shapes
    of pieces), Square (which forms big squares only out of whole
    tetrominoes), and Bombliss (which doesn't place a bomb in a block
    that has blocks on opposite sides of it within the piece, such as
    the middle of an I, J, L, or T).
  * Pieces can carry bomb blocks within them.  Not used yet,
    but will be used for Bombliss.
  * Option for sticky gravity.  This will also be used for Bombliss.
  * Options rearranged: game on top, control in middle,
    view on bottom.
  * Options menu uses a smaller font and scrolls if necessary (but
    it's not necessary just yet).
  * Zero isn't wider than other digits in the large or small font.
  * Split debrief screen into debrief.c.
  * Debrief displays lockdown and line clear gravity type.
  * List of options in debrief is written with smaller font.
  * Config screen does a better job of ignoring simultaneous presses
    on USB joystick adapters that map the Control Pad to both axes
    and buttons (such as EMS USB2).
  * Main menu and options always respond to the arrow keys (in
    addition to the keys set in Game Keys), allowing players to
    reset Game Keys even when the keys have become corrupted.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.11 (2006-08-01):
  * Added Instant, 20 Hz, 15 Hz, and 12 Hz sideways speeds.
  * Added randomizer History 6 Rolls, very similar to Move to Back
    but sometimes repeating recent tetrominoes.
  * Allows separate wall kick tables for clockwise and anticlockwise
    rotation.
  * New "theta=default" in piece->block expansion reflects the
    rotation system's initial orientations for new pieces, next
    pieces, and the hold piece.
  * Option to use Sega rotations instead of SRS rotations.
  * Option for ignoring diagonal presses.
  * Option for locking or not when using hard drop (Up).
  * Option to turn off smooth gravity animation.
  * Option to use TNT style T-spin detection instead of TDS style.
  * Debrief displays rotation system and T-spin detection.
  * Saves options to lj.ini.
  * Split options screen and wall kick table into separate source
    code files.
  * Plays music in stereo.
  * Site distributes contributed graphics and music files to
    replace the defaults.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.10 (2006-07-27):
  * Set default full screen color depth to 16-bit which may be more
    compatible than 15-bit.
  * Press Print Screen to save the current screen as ljsnap.bmp.
  * Plays next piece sound whenever the next column moves up.
    0.08-0.09 didn't do so for the first hold in a game.
  * No longer tries rotating right when rotating left fails.
  * Handles DirectDraw amnesia (screen corruption in Alt+Tab)
    correctly in menu, game play, and debrief screens.
  * Asset and video buffer cleanup consolidated into one function.
  * Gravity speeds up 50% faster.
  * Added options menu for selecting sideways movement speed and
    randomizer.
  * Added more randomizers: 14-piece bag, move-to-back (TGM style),
    memoryless (classic), and SZSZ (used in the well-known proof
    that memoryless cannot be played indefinitely).
  * Debrief screen displays date and time of report generation as
    well as randomizer and sideways speed, and logs what it displays
    to lj-scores.txt.
  * Moved all gimmick-specific code from lj.c to new file gimmicks.c.
  * Built against Allegro 4.2.0.  (Users of previous versions will
    need the new DLL.)
  * Countdown based gimmicks (40 lines, 180 seconds, Baboo!,
    TGM World, Drill 40) use the same countdown variable for
    end state detection that they had used for countdown sound.
  * Support for tracked music using DUMB.
  * Manual is HTML.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.09 (2006-07-16):
  * Reverted sideways kicks of I tetromino rotating from horizontal
    to vertical based on testing I-I interactions in Tetris DS.
  * Key pretending is more consistent.
  * TGM World stops at 290 lines, more like Tetris The Grand Master.
  * In gimmicks with ARE (currently TGM World), allows initial
    hard drop.
  * Licensed as free software under GNU General Public License.
  * Fixed incomplete first bag (0.08 regression).
  * Has its own icon instead of the wall kick editor's icon.
  * No double initial rotation when using initial hold in TGM World.
  * Input actions are a 32-bit record for future recording.
  * Hidden next piece is a separate variable, which next piece
    sound also respects, fixing Items.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.08 (2006-07-08):
  * Plays sounds for the next piece like TGM.
  * No longer allows 800x552 window now that 0.08 displays the
    gimmick name.
  * Supports spawn delay and line delay.
  * Supports initial hold and rotation.
  * Supports variable garbage randomness.
  * Begun to move gimmick code out of core.
  * Added TGM World gimmick:
    Standard S.M.G., except there's a half-second delay before each
    tetromino, and a half-second delay after each tetromino that
    forms at least one line. So if you want fast play, make more
    lines at once.
  * Added Drill 40 gimmick: 
    Like 40 lines, but the screen starts with 18 rows of garbage.
    Be prepared to rely on SRS infinite spin for the first few
    lines until your skill improves.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.07 (2006-06-30):
  * Added Baboo gimmick:
    Standard S.M.G., except there is no gravity, and the game
    ends after 300 keypresses.
  * Cleaned up the font a bit.
  * Corrected wall kicks for I tetromino to match an updated
    description provided by nicholas.  Specifically, I tetromino
    prefers kick-down to kick-up.
  * Removed sound-not-found debug message.
  * Plays "ready, go!" like TGM.
  * Bigger font for lines and time.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.06 (2006-06-25):
  * Gimmicks are sorted into columns.
  * Debrief responds to controller mapping.
  * Debrief shows keypresses per tetromino and garbage per minute.
  * Loads/saves vkey configuration from/to disk instead of
    prompting the user every time the program starts.
  * Build system switched to GNU Make.
  * Terminal window ("DOS box") hidden.
  * Responds to window system's close button.
  * Counts down 5-4-3-2-1 in line or time limited gimmicks.
  * Icon in the top left corner of the window is customized.
  * Displays ljbg.jpg in the window's blank space.
  * Displays blocks from ljblocks.bmp.
  * Releases the CPU for 5ms per frame when possible, so that
    background tasks such as a music player can keep up.
  * Increased sound effects' volume so that music players do not
    completely overpower them.
  * Added macros for rotate twice, move far left, and move far right.
  * Corrected fix to alternation between falling and landed states
    that occurred especially when sliding a tetromino to the right
    under high gravity.
  * Added Items gimmick:
    Standard S.M.G., except after the first 7 pieces you get
    random starting orientations, no rotation, and hidden next
    pieces, and the speed goes to 1G.  Every time you are given an
    I piece, either you get 2 lines of garbage or the columns of
    blocks in the well are shuffled.
  * Fixed scoring tables in README.txt.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.05 (2006-06-23):
  * Included readme.txt.
  * Debrief report shows more decimal places in time and PPM.
  * Game over plays a simple animation and sound.
  * Playfield can be resized (with a recompile).
  * Removed hardcoded key binding help text.
  * Window is bigger in preparation for wallpaper.
  * Display mode is 15/16/24/32-bit in preparation for wallpaper.
  * Added Low Rider gimmick:
    Standard S.M.G. with an 8-block-tall visible playfield.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.04 (2006-06-22):
  * Uses an OS-native bitmap rather than an Allegro bitmap,
    which may allow faster drawing with some video cards.
  * Allows play from a keyboard or a joystick.
  * Presents a key configuration screen when the program starts.
  * A 500ms delay after the game ends. Drama will come soon to this
    space.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.03 (2006-06-21):
  * Debriefing responds only to Esc, Enter, and keypad Enter.
  * Compensates for refresh rates other than 60 Hz.
  * Change log included with program.
  * Plays sound effects for shift, rotate, land, lock, line, b2b.
  * Bigger text using the "Aver" font.
  * Lock delay in Marathon decreases gradually after gravity
    surpasses 20G.
  * Reads keys through a bitfield, allowing for custom key->vkey
    bindings to be implemented in the future.
  * (Internal) Does not alternate between "falling" and "landed"
    states when resetting lock delay on slide.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.02 (2006-06-19):
  * Speed level progresses 1/3 as fast.
  * Added menu for selecting a gimmick (game mode) to play.
  * Added Marathon gimmick:
    Like Vs. but no garbage.
  * Added 40 lines gimmick:
    Like Marathon but ends after 40 lines.
  * Added 3 minutes gimmick (like Marathon but ends after 10800
    frames).
  * Added Rhythm gimmick:
    20G, and if you fall below the minimum PPM, it automatically
    locks the tetromino, and the minimum PPM increases by 10 every
    64 tetrominoes.
  * Debriefing computes PPM and score.
  * Debriefing returns to gimmick selection instead of exiting
    the program.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.01 (2006-06-14):
